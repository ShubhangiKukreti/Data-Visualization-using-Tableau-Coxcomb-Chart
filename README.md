**NIGHTINGALE'S ROSE CHART**

This project is a recreation of Nightingale's Rose Chart which portrays the causes for the deaths of soldiers in the British Army. Each sector of the chart represents a month which is further divided based on the cause of deaths. The reason behind the deaths are represented using different colors. The causes are wounds and injuries which are depicted by the colour blue, zymotic diseases which are depicted as orange and all the other causes which are depicted by the colour red. The months are arranged in an ascending order starting from April 1854 and are further plotted till March 1855 following anti-clockwise direction. This type of a chrt is also known as a coxcomb chart. 

Historic data was used to recreate the chart and Tableau Prep was used to prep the data and Tableau Desktop was used to craete the chart. The details of each sector can be observed by hovering the mouse over it.
